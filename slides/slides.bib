  abstract = {One of the central problems in machine learning and pattern
              recognition is to develop appropriate representations for complex
              data. We consider the problem of constructing a representation for
              data lying on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a
              high-dimensional space. Drawing on the correspondence between the
              graph Laplacian, the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and
              the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically
              motivated algorithm for representing the high-dimensional data. The
              algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to
              nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality-preserving
              properties and a natural connection to clustering. Some potential
              applications and illustrative examples are discussed.},
